# ToDo App in Sinatra


### The idea is we shall make a ToDo app and use sinatra and a lot of other libraries. The futures of the app will be  as follows:

* Each user can have multiple todo list

* Each todo list will have multiple items

* Todo lists can be private, public, or shared with a group

* Items in each todo list can be assigned to user or group
 

The modules that we will build are as follows:

* Users: This will manage users and groups

* List: This will manage the todo lists

* Items: This will manage the items for all the todo lists
